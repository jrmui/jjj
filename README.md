Spooktacular NVIDIA Data Science Competition
First ever hackathon!!

The Challenge
The ultimate question remains: Who is the Scariest Monster of them all? 🏆💀 Your task is a regression to predict the target variable, “y” — the number of votes each monster received in the global terror poll. Note: You are required to use either pandas or Polars DataFrames in your solution.

Received an RMSE of: 651.48060 (at some point this was the 10th best submission!! XD)
Highest Scorer was: 624.83802

Learned a lot about how to apply EDA and use LASSO and RIDGE models to optimize selection of features!
